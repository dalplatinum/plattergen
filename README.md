I only started learning javascript recently, so don't expect too much.
Shoutouts to https://github.com/vincent7128 for text-image and https://modernweb.com/user/donovanh/ for his great article on particle basics.

Well, it works.  But the code is a mess and the comments are sparse.  It's also most likely incredibly inefficient.
